# Credit Risk Modelling

## Introduction
Credit risk analysis is the practice of determining the likelihood that a borrower will default on their financial obligations. It is a crucial aspect of the financial industry as it helps lenders, such as banks and credit institutions, manage and mitigate potential losses due to defaults.

## Objective of Credit Risk Analysis
The primary goal of credit risk analysis is to understand the risk involved in lending to different borrowers. By assessing the probability of default, financial institutions can make informed decisions about who to lend to, under what terms, and at what rates. This not only optimizes the risk-return profile but also helps in complying with various financial regulations.

## Importance
Proper credit risk management:

1. Minimizes losses by avoiding lending to high-risk individuals or businesses.
2. Improves profitability by setting appropriate interest rates based on the borrower’s risk profile.
3. Enhances customer management by customizing loan offers and terms.
4. Ensures regulatory compliance by adhering to credit risk thresholds set by financial authorities.


## Project Goal
In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model using historical data to assess the credit risk of potential borrowers. This model will help in predicting the likelihood of default, thereby assisting lenders in making more precise lending decisions.

## Methodology
We will use various machine learning techniques to predict credit risk. The process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data and creating relevant features.
Model Building: Using statistical and machine learning models to learn from past data.
Evaluation: Assessing the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.
Optimization: Fine-tuning the model to enhance its predictive accuracy.
By the end of this project, we expect to have a robust tool that can be used to improve decision-making in credit lending.
